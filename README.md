Welcome! 

This is a draft of an online "User Manual" for a vascular surgery service.  While going through training I always wish I had a quick reference for all the ways things were done at my institution.  I found textbooks useful, but my attendings or instituion always did things a little different or there had been more updated reports that had slightly different recommendations.  I wish I had an institution/surgeon specific reference for the different care pathways so that I could make sure that every patient got the same high quality care every time.

The goal of this document is as a template based around some of the best recommendations, but that can be easily customizable for each local institution/surgeon.  The online format allows for embedding of links, citations, decision aids and far more that are not available in other digital or print media.

Thank you for joining in this collaborative effort.
