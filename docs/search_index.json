EVAR is more commonly used in the emergent or symptomatic setting and discharge is determined by patient stability and comorbidities. 2.1 Common Issues Femoral access issues - the majority of procedures are performed with percutaneous access, but many require a cut-down and arterial repair if there are issues with large bore femoral access. Endoleak - Most endoleaks should be corrected before leaving the OR, but some patients have small Type 1 or 2 endoleaks that can be watched and may seal on their own. It is important for the team to be aware of patients with ongoing leaks in the perioperative period. Acute graft syndrome - Patients sometimes have a physiologic response to graft implantation that includes abdominal pain, fever, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. These patients should have a traditional fever workup to rule out other causes of sepsis, but if more dangerous etiologies are ruled out, this can be managed conservatively. Colonic ischemia - The IMA is covered in all of these procedures. Rarely, this results in colonic ischemia. This presents with worsening abdominal pain, bloody stools and signs of sepsis. Immediate management should be resuscitation and endoscopy. 2.2 Post-op Pathway 2.2.1 POD 0 Level of care: Stepdown Diet: Comorbidity specific diet Activity: Bedrest overnight Labs: PACU: CBC, Chem 7 depending blood loss and comorbidities AM: CBC, Chem 7 Nursing: Neurovascular checks bilateral lower extremities Medications Pain control – non-opiates often sufficient Cardiac – restart home BP medications Antibiotics - 24hr perioperative abx (Ancef 2g q8 x2 doses) 2.2.2 POD 1-Discharge Level of care: Transfer to floor status or discharge home Activity: OOB with assistance and ambulate TID Wound care: Remove groin dressings "],["complex-evar-zfen-pmeg-parallel-graft.html", "Chapter 3 Complex EVAR (Zfen, PMEG, Parallel graft) 3.1 Common issues 3.2 Post-op Pathway", " Chapter 3 Complex EVAR (Zfen, PMEG, Parallel graft) Patients with complex thoracoabdominal aneurysms with significant comorbidities can be repaired with custom fenestrated endovascular devices. This can be done as a standalone procedure or as part of a staged repair of a more extensive aneurysm. Disposition for these patients is often limited more by their comorbidities instead of the procedure themselves. 3.1 Common issues Femoral access issues – the majority of procedures are performed with percutaneous access, but many require a cut-down and arterial repair if there are issues with large bore femoral access. If you are called to evaluate determine hemodynamic stability of the patient, presence of hematoma, ecchymosis, pseudoaneurysm or active bleeding. Most can be solved with additional pressure but may require a skin stitch or further evaluation with imaging.

Immediate management should be resuscitation and endoscopy. Visceral arterial occlusion – The SMA, Celiac and renal arteries are accessed and stented during these procedures. They should be followed closely for signs of hepatic, mesenteric or renal ischemia. Spinal ischemia – depending on the extent of the aneurysm these patients are at high risk for spinal ischemia. Preventative measures to reduce spinal ischemia include optimizing tissue oxygenation by avoiding anemia and hypotension and spinal drain placement.

Any neuro changes should be thoroughly evaluated and stroke should be ruled out if focal neurologic deficits persist. Bleeding - Bleeding from the carotid incision has high morbidity due to compromise of the airway. Patients with increasing hematoma or signs of airway obstruction should be evaluated and escalated immediately. Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome – Patients with very tight stenosis or bilateral disease can develop hyperperfusion, which presents as headache and hypertension. This is very serious and if hypertension is not controlled can progress to seizures. 6.2 Post-op Pathway 6.2.1 POD 0 Level of care: 7 Hudson North Stepdown Diet: NPO for 6 hours until the neuro exam is stable and then comorbidity specific diet Activity: Bedrest for 6 hours until neuro exam stable and then OOB and ambulate TID Labs: AM CBC and Chem 7 Nursing: Neuro checks for 6hrs postoperatively Wound checks D/C aline and foley at 6hrs if neuro checks stable Medications Pain - non-opiates often sufficient Cardiac - resume all home BP meds with hold parameters for SBP &lt;120 and HR &lt; 50.

We often access via the femoral artery, but can also access through the upper extremity or distal in the lower extremity. We sometimes perform debridements at the same time. The majority of patients can go back to their primary team or are discharged the same day pending management of comorbidities. 7.1 Common issues Femoral access issues – the majority of procedures are performed with percutaneous access, but many require a cut-down and arterial repair if there are issues with large bore femoral access. If you are called to evaluate determine hemodynamic stability of the patient, presence of hematoma, ecchymosis, pseudoaneurysm or active bleeding. Most can be solved with additional pressure but may require a skin stitch or further evaluation with imaging. Graft occlusion - Any increasing pain, change in neuro exam, or loss of signals in the operative extremity should be escalated quickly as this can be a sign of early graft failure which is likely a technical issue and can be salvaged if acted upon quickly. 7.2 Post-op Pathway 7.2.1 POD 0 Level of care: Back to pre-operative service/room or discharged home Diet: Comorbidity specific diet Activity: Bedrest with HOB at 30 degrees for 4-6 hours depending on closure device and access size, to be determined by fellow or attending.

These patients require a subsequent return to the OR for the management of thrombosis and underlying etiology. Patients remain in ICU for 24-48hrs and in the hospital for up to a week pending clinical course. 8.1 Common issues Bleeding - catheter-based administration of TPA can cause system coagulopathy so these patients are monitored closely for bleeding with frequent labs and physical exams. Bleeding can present as bleeding from the access site, retroperitoneal hematoma, GI bleed or stroke. 8.2 Perioperative Pathway 8.2.1 Pre-op Medications 10mg tPA bolus tPA drip 12mg in 250cc - add comment “To be administered through the thrombolysis catheter, DO NOT mix until notified by the OR staff” Heparin 300u - add comment “To be administered through the arterial sheath.” 8.2.2 POD 0 Level of care: SICU Diet: Clear liquids, advance to comorbidity specific diet on POC Activity: Bedrest Labs: q6 CBC, PTT, PT/INR, fibrinogen, active T&amp;S at all times Nursing: Neuro checks Neurovascular checks of affected extremities Catheter care Frequent exams for signs of bleeding Wound care The access site is secured with ioban.

Patients usually stay for 3-5 days post-operatively. 9.1 Common issues Managing comorbidities - These are often patients with significant comorbidities that often extend the post-operative course more than issues related to their surgeries. Close attention should be paid to their home medications and management of underlying cardiac disease, hypertension, diabetes or cerebrovascular disease. Bleeding - These patients should be monitored closely for bleeding, particularly when on anticoagulation Graft occlusion - Any increasing pain, change in neuro exam, or loss of signals in the operative extremity should be escalated quickly as this can be a sign of early graft failure which is likely a technical issue and can be salvaged if acted upon quickly. Wound infection – Groin wounds are particularly prone to infection. We sometimes utilize Prevena VAC dressings over a closed wound to reduce the risk of infection. These wounds should be kept dry and evaluated daily to ensure no signs of dehiscence or infection. Unlikely to present in the immediate post-operative period, but should be kept in mind. 9.2 Perioperative Pathway 9.2.1 POD 0 Level of care: Stepdown Diet: Comorbidity specific diet Activity: Bedrest overnight Labs: PACU: CBC, Chem 7 depending blood loss and comorbidities AM: CBC, Chem 7 Nursing: Foley Neurovascular checks per protocol Wound care Elevate on 2 pillows Dressing and ace wrapping is attending and patient specific Medications Pain – standing Tylenol, PCA Cardiac – restart home BP meds Antibiotics – 24hr perioperative abx (Ancef 2g q8 x2 doses) Heme – DVT ppx, aspirin 81 Plavix and AC pending attending discretion Endocrine – Insulin CDI 9.2.2 POD 1 Level of care: Floor status if no cardiac events overnight Activity: OOB with assistance, PT/OT evaluation for dispo planning Labs: AM CBC, Chem 7 Nursing: D/C Foley, DTV Continue neurovascular checks Wound care Takedown wrap Leave dressing if no concerns for infection or bleeding, remove if any question Medications Pain – transition to PO regimen Cardiac – Continue home medications Antibiotics – Stop if no signs of infection or distal signs of gangrene Endocrine – titrate insulin after starting a diet 9.2.3 POD 2 - Discharge Activity: Ambulate TID Labs: AM CBC, Chem 7 Wound care: All dressings should be removed, and dressing wound with dry gauze per patient preference Medications Hep lock if possible Dispo planning Follow up on PT/OT evaluation, coordinate potential rehab or Patient education – signs, and symptoms of acute limb ischemia "],["amputation.html", "Chapter 10 Amputation 10.1 Common Issues 10.2 Perioperative Pathway", " Chapter 10 Amputation Length of stay is often limited by management of patient comorbidities.

These may be wounds related to arterial disease, venous stasis, diabetes or trauma. Patients stay at a minimum of 4-5 days until the initial operative dressing is removed. 11.1 Common issues VAC malfunction - most patients have a VAC coming out of the OR. Ideally, the VAC stays in place without manipulation until the reveal. If the VAC is malfunctioning it should be fixed ASAP and reinforced to ensure an adequate seal. If it cannot be repaired it can be removed under the observation of a senior or attending. 11.2 Perioperative Pathway 11.2.1 POD 0-3 Level of care: Floor or pre-operative level of care, we often take these patients onto our service after STSG Diet: Comorbidity specific diet Activity: Bedrest, sometimes can be OOB with bathroom privileges Labs: AM CBC and Chem 7 Wound care: VAC at -125 mmHg at all times.

They either present as inpatient consults or outpatients who undergo same-day procedures. 12.1 Common issues Access maturation – We often need to address the acute need for dialysis with temporary catheters until access matures. The earliest most surgical access can be used is 4-6wks post-operatively, but depends on maturation particularly for autogenous fistulas. Bleeding – Access ulcerations or bleeding after access in HD can be vascular emergencies. Acute bleeding can often be controlled with a permanent figure of 8 stitch and a pressure dressing. Depending on the extent of ulceration or severity of bleeding, then the patient should either be taken emergently to the OR for ligation/revision or evaluated for central stenosis via ultrasound. Thrombosis – these are often managed by medical teams and IR, but sometimes we are called to assist if it is relatively fresh access that we created. Steal syndrome – presents as acute or chronic limb ischemia, often associated with worsening pain, motor or sensory deficits. 12.2 Perioperative Pathway 12.2.1 Pre-op Diet: NPO at midnight the night before the planned procedure Radiology: Bilateral upper extremity venous mapping Nursing: Limb alert on the non-dominant upper extremity, remove all IVs 12.2.2 POD 0 Level of care: Back to primary team or discharge to home Diet: Renal diet Activity: No heavy lifting in operated extremity Nursing: Neurovascular checks until discharge from PACU Wound care: All dressings should be removed, and dressing wound with dry gauze per patient preference 12.2.3 POD 1 Wound care: All dressings should be removed, and dressing wound with dry gauze per patient preference "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
