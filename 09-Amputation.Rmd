# Amputation

Length of stay is often limited by management of patient comorbidities.  However, if well controlled, length of stay is usually 4-5 days pending adequate stump healing and evaluation by physical therapy.

## Common Issues
1. **Wound infection or flap ischemia** â€“ sometimes it is difficult to distinguish, and these can present with erythema and drainage.  Both may require washout and revision and should be monitored closely.
